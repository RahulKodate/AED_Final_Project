Disaster Management Network
The main goal of the DMN project is to strengthen the Disaster Management Network in the United States of America and improve the effectiveness of disaster preparedness and response at the city level by promoting the network of governmental and non-governmental disaster management organizations.

Disaster risks and the effect of climate change on their scale and intensity are specific to the United States of America. To adapt to the new challenges, DMN gathers the relevant stakeholders while trying to reach and engage other target groups.

The objectives of DMN are strongly connected to the governance framework, as they are directly focusing on activities that support most of its priorities:
“Understanding disaster risk” by focusing on policies and practices and promoting joint efforts in partnership with the research and development community.
“Strengthening of disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk” by fostering collaboration across regional mechanisms and promoting mutual learning and exchanging good practices and information.
“Enhancing disaster preparedness" for effective response by developing and strengthening coordinated regional approaches and operational mechanisms to prepare for and ensure rapid and effective disaster response in situations that exceed national coping capacities, also promoting the further development and dissemination of instruments.
